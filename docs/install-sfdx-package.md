## Jobs

This workflow has one job:
- **install-package** - installs an SFDX package on a target org using information from the source project to determine the package id

### install-package

1. Does a sparse checkout of the project, only checking out the `sfdx-project.json` file and the `deploy` directory
   (if it exists).
2. Connects to the DevHub org (using the `devhub-instance-url`, `devhub-username`, `devhub-client-id`, and 
   `devhub-jwt-key-encrypted` inputs), and to the target org (using the `instance-url`, `username`, `client-id`, and
   `jwt-key-encrypted` inputs) using JWT authentication.
3. Finds the package version on the DevHub org using either the `package` input as a package version id, if specified,
   or, otherwise, using the package id from the project's `sfdx-project.json` and the package version number from the 
   `version-number` input. This workflow will only ever install released (also called promoted) package versions, and
   since only one package build can be promoted for the same (major, minor, patch) triplet, the build number must be
   omitted from the `version-number` input, e.g. `1.0.1`. So the version number is incomplete, and the workflow will
   find the build number of the released package version with the given major, minor, and patch numbers to construct a
   complete `major.minor.patch.build` version number, e.g. `1.0.1.2`.
4. Installs the package version onto the target org, compiling only Apex classes and triggers in the package (as
   opposed to _all_ Apex on the target org).
5. Runs any post-install scripts present in the `deploy/hooks/post-deploy` directory, in alphabetical order. The 
   script files must have a `.sh` extension and will always be run through Bash regardless of what shebang line, 
   if any, is present at the start of the file. The scripts run in the same environment as the workflow, so they
   can call the Salesforce CLI using either the `dev-hub` org alias to refer to the DevHub org, or the `target-org`
   org alias to refer to the target org on which the package version was installed. 
   **NB:  These scripts run with the permissions of the user specified using the `username` (or `devhub-username` 
   for the DevHub org) input. This user will likely have administrative permissions, since these are required to install 
   a package. So these scripts should be peer-reviewed carefully before allowing this workflow to run them.**
